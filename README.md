## About

This is an application I built as a final solo project before my bootcamp graduation. It was inspired by my passion of outdoor activities such as hiking and landscape photographing. The users will need to create an account to be able to access. Once logged in, users will be able to see trails that was posted by anyone. However,only the one who created the posts may edit their own posts.

## Available Commands

In the project directory, you can run:

### `"npm start"`,

The app is built using `vite` so this command Runs the app in Development mode. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser. You also need to run this command in both client and server directores using the same command, `npm start`, as well to completely run the app. This would launch `nodemon` and allow files on server side each time you update files. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `"npm run build"`,

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app will be ready to deploy!
